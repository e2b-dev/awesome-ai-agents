## [Teenage AGI](https://github.com/seanpixel/Teenage-AGI/blob/main/README.md#experiments)

A BabyAGI-inspired agent that can recall infinite memory, "thinks" before making action, and doesn't lose memory after being shutting down
<details>

### Description
- Model: GPT-4
- Language: Python
- Uses OpenAI and Pinecone to give memory to an AI agent and also allows it to "think" before making an action (outputting text)
- Also, just by shutting down the AI, it doesn't forget its memories since it lives on Pinecone and its memory counter saves the index that it's on
- A process that happens every time the AI is queried by the user:
	- AI vectorizes the query and stores it in a Pinecone Vector Database
	- AI looks inside its memory and finds memories and past queries that are relevant to the current query
	- AI thinks about what action to take
	- AI stores the thought from Step 3
	- Based on the thought from Step 3 and relevant memories from Step 2, AI generates an output
	- AI stores the current query and its answer in its Pinecone vector database memory

## [WorkGPT](https://github.com/team-openpm/workgpt)
A GPT agent framework for invoking APIs
<details>

### Description
- WorkGPT is an agent framework in a similar fashion to AutoGPT or LangChain. You give it a directive and an array of APIs and it will converse back and forth with the AI until its directive is complete.
- For example, a directive could be to research the web for something, to crawl a website, or to order you an Uber. We support any and all APIs that can be represented with an OpenAPI file.
- WorkGPT now has OpenAI's new function invocation feature baked into it
	- While chaining together APIs was possible before (see AutoGPT), it was slow, expensive, and error prone
	- [The tweet announcing this feature](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1669367224694607875)

## [MultiOn](https://multion.ai/)
AI personal agent, holding the record for the first AI flight booking, food order (a burger) & workplace cert
<details>

### Description
- The agent runs and controls the local Google Chrome, which allows it to interact with the world/services/web apps, just like people interact with the world/services/web apps using Google Chrome
- The agent itself probably also runs locally and currently, it needs the local Google Chrome to function
- Our understanding from the demo video is that they use local code and a custom plugin in ChatGPT to control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome). This setup enables MultiOn to perform tasks like ordering plane tickets as if a human were interacting with the browser directly
- Use cases
	- A lot of cool real use cases, e.g.,
	-Sending an email fully autonomously
	-Posting a tweet
	-Sending a tweet reply to a specific person with a specific message
	-Sending a Facebook message to a friend
	-Searching for vacation rentals and check pricing for an upcoming trip
	-Searching for a wedding venue and starting the wedding planning process
	-Scheduling a car wash
- After introducing the GPT function calling, MultiOn can call itself recursively to spawn more sub-agents
- Instead of calling multiple functions or APIs you just need one Universal Function that can interact with all services and have it call itself to accomplish more complex tasks in parallel
