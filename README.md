## [Agents](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents)

Library/framework for building language agents

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents/raw/master/assets/agents-logo.png)

### Category
General purpose, Build your own, Multi-agent

### Description
-   **Long-short Term Memory**: Language agents in the library are equipped with both long-term memory implemented via VectorDB + Semantic Search and short-term memory (working memory) maintained and updated by an LLM.
-   **Tool Usage**: Language agents in the library can use any external tools via  [function-calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)  and developers can add customized tools/APIs  [here](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents/blob/master/src/agents/Component/ToolComponent.py).
-   **Web Navigation**: Language agents in the library can use search engines to navigate the web and get useful information.
-   **Multi-agent Communication**: In addition to single language agents, the library supports building multi-agent systems in which language agents can communicate with other language agents and the environment. Different from most existing frameworks for multi-agent systems that use pre-defined rules to control the order for agents' action,  **Agents**  includes a  _controller_  function that dynamically decides which agent will perform the next action using an LLM by considering the previous actions, the environment, and the target of the current states. This makes multi-agent communication more flexible.
-   **Human-Agent interaction**: In addition to letting language agents communicate with each other in an environment, our framework seamlessly supports human users to play the role of the agent by himself/herself and input his/her own actions, and interact with other language agents in the environment.
-   **Symbolic Control**: Different from existing frameworks for language agents that only use a simple task description to control the entire multi-agent system over the whole task completion process,  **Agents**  allows users to use an  **SOP (Standard Operation Process)**  that defines subgoals/subtasks for the overall task to customize fine-grained workflows for the language agents.

LangChain agent for chemistry-related tasks

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/ur-whitelab/chemcrow-public/raw/main/assets/chemcrow_dark_bold.png)

### Category
Science, Chemistry

### Description
- ChemCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive chemical tasks
- It integrates 13 expert-design tools to augment LLM performance in chemistry and demonstrate effectiveness in automating chemical tasks
- Built with Langchain
- The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output. It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation. One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results. (Source: [Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered Autonomous Agents".

### Description
[*data-to-paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17605) is a framework for systematically navigating the power of AI to perform complete end-to-end 
scientific research, starting from raw data and concluding with comprehensive, transparent, and human-verifiable 
scientific papers.

Towards this goal, *data-to-paper* systematically guides interacting 
LLM and rule-based agents through the conventional scientific path, from annotated data, through creating 
research hypotheses, conducting literature search, writing and debugging data analysis code, 
interpreting the results, and ultimately the step-by-step writing of a complete research paper.

The *data-to-paper* framework is created as a research project to understand the 
capacities and limitations of LLM-driven scientific research, and to develop ways of harnessing LLM to accelerate 
research while maintaining, and even enhancing, key scientific values, such as transparency, traceability and verifiability, 
and while allowing scientist to oversee and direct the process

Language Agents as Optimizable Graphs

### Category
Build-your-own (agent-builing frameworks and platforms), General purpose, Multi-agent

### Description
- 🐝 GPTSwarm is a graph-based framework for LLM-based agents, providing two high-level features:
  - It lets you build LLM-based agents from graphs.
  - It enables the customized and automatic self-organization of agent swarms with self-improvement capabilities.
- Various human-designed prompt engineering techniques have been proposed to improve problem solvers based on Large Language Models (LLMs), yielding many disparate code bases. We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. Each node implements a function to process multimodal data or query other LLMs. Each edge describes the information flow between operations and agents. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration. Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization). Experiments demonstrate that our framework can be used to efficiently develop, integrate, and automatically improve diverse LLM agents.

![image](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/raw/main/docs/assets/langroid-card-lambda-ossem-rust-1200-630.png)

### Category
General purpose, Build your own

### Description


`Langroid` is an intuitive, lightweight, extensible and principled
Python framework to easily build LLM-powered applications.
You set up Agents, equip them with optional components (LLM,
vector-store and methods), assign them tasks, and have them
collaboratively solve a problem by exchanging messages.
This Multi-Agent paradigm is inspired by the
[Actor Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
(but you do not need to know anything about this!).

`Langroid` is a fresh take on LLM app-development, where considerable thought has gone
into simplifying the developer experience; it does not use `Langchain`.

- Works with most commercial/remote and open/local LLMs.
- Set up Multi-agent, multi-LLM system: use stronger LLMs for agents requiring strong reasoning and instruction-following, and delegate simpler tasks to weaker/local LLMs. 
- Supports OpenAI function-calling as well as native equivalent called `ToolMessage`, which works with LLMs that 
  do not have built-in function-calling. Simply specify structure as a (nested) Pydantic object.
- Batteries-included: vector-databases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), caching, logging/observability.
- Specialized agents available: `DocChatAgent`, `SQLChatAgent`, `TableChatAgent` (for tabular data, e.g. csv/dataframes).
- `DocChatAgent` handles text, PDF, Docx files/URLS, and has state-of-the art techniques 
   for retrieval combining lexical and semantic search.

### Category
Productivity, Coding

### Description
Lemon agent is a Plan-Validate-Solve (PVS) Agent for accurate, reliable and reproducable workflow automation
- A standalone supervised Plan and Solve Agent specialized on performing read and write operations on various tools like GitHub, HubSpot or Airtable _(ACL 2023 Paper "[Plan-and-Solve Prompting: Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091)")_
- **Separation of tasks and human-in-the-loop interactions**: Lemon Agent is currently holding a Planner Agent and a Solver Agent to keep the agents focussed and increase accuracy. We are planning on adding additional agents real soon. In addition, Lemon Agent will ask for approval at relevant workflow steps to make sure the intended actions are executed.
- **Unlimited configuration options**: Lemon Agent gives you unlimited configuration options (see example here) when defining your workflow. For instance, you can tell Lemon Agent to ask for permission before executing a workflow step or to drop a 🧔‍♀️ dad joke every time the model executes a workflow step.
- **UI flexibility**: Build any UI on top or engage with Lemon Agent via the built-in CLI.
- **[Soon] Model & framework agnostic operations**: Lemon Agent is a standalone agent, but can easily be integrated into frameworks like LangChain and be used with any model.
- **Bonus**: Identify weak spots in your agent’s decision-making capabilities and move to a more deterministic behavior by further configuring your Lemon Agent workflows. **(.html file that can be run without any additional installation)**

### Category
Multi-agent, Coding, Build your own

### Description
L2MAC is a multi-agent generation framework that, a single input prompt can generate an extensive unbounded output, such as an entire codebase or an entire book.
- L2MAC can create near unbounded outputs that align exactly with the user input prompt over very long generation tasks
- It achieves strong empirical performance of state-of-the-art generation for large codebase tasks and is in the top 3 for the HumanEval coding global benchmark. As L2MAC can detect invalid code and failing unit tests when generating code and automatically error corrects them.
- Internally persists a complete file-store memory that enables LLM agents to read files and write to files, creating a large output over many iterations
- It can be instructed to follow an exact prompt program
- As it generates the output one part at a time, it enables an LLM with a fixed context token limit to be bypassed
- The paper, peer-reviewed and recently accepted and published at ICLR 2024, introduces L2MAC.

## [SWE Agent](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent)
Open-source Devin alternative

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/raw/main/assets/swe-agent-banner.png)
### Category
Coding, general purpose

### Description
- This Devin alternative scores 12.3% on the FULL swe benchmark
- ["An open source Devin getting 12.29% on 100% of the SWE Bench test set vs Devin's 13.84% on 25% of the test set!"](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1775120334305607781)
- SWE-agent works by interacting with a specialized terminal, which allows it to:
	- 🔍 Open, scroll and search through files
	- ✍️ Edit specific lines w/ automatic syntax check
	- 🧪 Write and execute tests
- This custom-built interface is critical for good performance. Simply connecting an LM to a vanilla bash terminal does not work well.
- ["Our key insight is that LMs require carefully designed agent-computer interfaces (similar to how humans like  good UI design). E.g. When the LM messes up indentation, our editor prevents it and gives feedback."](https://x.com/jyangballin/status/1775114448513958134)
- SWE-agent was released by the Princeton NLP team.
- What makes SWE-agent special is that it performs almost as well as Devin on the SWE-bench.
- It is important to say that the performance [varies](https://www.swebench.com/) based on the model used by the agent.
- The changes and innovations in SWE-agent compared to Devin are:
  - The code in SWE Agent is executed locally via Docker.
  - It uses “Agent-Computer Interface” (ACI) - constraining the interface makes the agent easier to use for LMs. Only a few commants are allowed: run code, look for code, edit code and submit changes to GitHub.
- Any code the agent writes goes through a syntax check (linter) before being submitted. If the syntax is incorrect, the agent gets feedback and is forced to redo the code.
- The agent can only read 100 lines of code at a time, rather than the entire file. This makes it easier for the language model to understand the code.

<details>

### Category
General purpose

### Description
A BabyAGI-inspired agent that can recall infinite memory, "thinks" before making action, and doesn't lose memory after being shutting down
- Model: GPT-4
- Language: Python
- Uses OpenAI and Pinecone to give memory to an AI agent and also allows it to "think" before making an action (outputting text)
- Also, just by shutting down the AI, it doesn't forget its memories since it lives on Pinecone and its memory counter saves the index that it's on
- A process that happens every time the AI is queried by the user:
	- AI vectorizes the query and stores it in a Pinecone Vector Database
	- AI looks inside its memory and finds memories and past queries that are relevant to the current query
	- AI thinks about what action to take
	- AI stores the thought from Step 3
	- Based on the thought from Step 3 and relevant memories from Step 2, AI generates an output
	- AI stores the current query and its answer in its Pinecone vector database memory

### Description
Vanna is an Open-Source Python-based AI SQL agent trained on your schema that writes complex SQL in seconds
- AI-driven business intelligence assistant
- Vanna helps you generate and run accurate SQL for your database using LLMs via Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Vanna works in two easy steps - train a RAG "model" on your data, and then ask questions which will return SQL queries that can be set up to automatically run on your database
- The Vanna Python package and the various frontend integrations are all open-source
- Vanna’s capabilities are tied to the training data you give it. More training data means better accuracy for large and complex datasets
- Your database contents are never sent to the LLM. The metadata storage layer only sees schemas, documentation, and queries
- As you use Vanna more, your model continuously improves as we augment your training data

## [WorkGPT](https://github.com/team-openpm/workgpt)
GPT agent framework for invoking APIs

![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1744902310336118784/AVnD3MC-?format=jpg&name=medium)

### Category
Coding

### Description
- WorkGPT is an agent framework in a similar fashion to AutoGPT or LangChain. You give it a directive and an array of APIs and it will converse back and forth with the AI until its directive is complete.
- For example, a directive could be to research the web for something, to crawl a website, or to order you an Uber. We support any and all APIs that can be represented with an OpenAPI file.
- WorkGPT now has OpenAI's new function invocation feature baked into it
	- While chaining together APIs was possible before (see AutoGPT), it was slow, expensive, and error prone

### Category
Productivity, General purpose

### Description
- The agent runs and controls the local Google Chrome, which allows it to interact with the world/services/web apps, just like people interact with the world/services/web apps using Google Chrome
- The agent itself probably also runs locally and currently, it needs the local Google Chrome to function
- Our understanding from the demo video is that they use local code and a custom plugin in ChatGPT to control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome). This setup enables MultiOn to perform tasks like ordering plane tickets as if a human were interacting with the browser directly
- Use cases
	- A lot of cool real use cases, e.g.,
	-Sending an email fully autonomously
	-Posting a tweet
	-Sending a tweet reply to a specific person with a specific message
	-Sending a Facebook message to a friend
	-Searching for vacation rentals and check pricing for an upcoming trip
	-Searching for a wedding venue and starting the wedding planning process
	-Scheduling a car wash
- After introducing the GPT function calling, MultiOn can call itself recursively to spawn more sub-agents
- Instead of calling multiple functions or APIs you just need one Universal Function that can interact with all services and have it call itself to accomplish more complex tasks in parallel
